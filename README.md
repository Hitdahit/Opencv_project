# Opencv_project
---
* I'll upload (opencv tutorial code + comments) and my project using opencv.
## Lane Recognition Project
* This project will be written with C++. 
* From now on, this project's strategy is using lane's color(which is typically white and yellow) and canny function as a ready for Hough Transform.
* I will develop this project with my own insights. Progress will be written in here.

## Open_YOLO Project summary
* I will construct YOLO network in C++, to make object detector in video files.

* Not only this, but also I will check my model's throughput and measure workloads.
  * I want to study about Real Time Issue in object detection Problem. This is why I'm doing this project.

    ### Here is sample image of my project.
